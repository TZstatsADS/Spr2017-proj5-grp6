### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Fulldata is downloaded from Kaggle FIFA dataset


The rest of the data are downloaded from http://info.nowgoal.com/en/League.aspx?SclassID=36
